<p>I am Bhavnoor Singh, a final year undergraduate at Dept of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Bombay. Hailing from Nakodar (Gate of Goodness), a small town in the Doaba Reagion of Punjab, our jadi pind (ancestral village) is Jahangir, now in Tarantaran. For those not aware, it is a common in Punjab, espcially in Kamboj community to identity oneself and others through ancestral tracts. I enjoy travelling and experiencing different cultures and have sustained my way to Germany, Italy, Singapore, Canada and US. Nevertheless I enjoy the rich diversity of my own nation. </p>

<p>Just like cultures, I like interdisiplinary research. Right now I am working with Prof. William Gornall at Sauder School of Business, UBC on Exploring arbitrage opportunities in crypto futures. At IITB, I have also been a part of Devcom - The Developers Comunity of IITB and 2 Maharastra Engineering Regiment</p>
