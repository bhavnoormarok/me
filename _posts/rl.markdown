This project is about one of my favourite topics : RL. But unlike usual RL where we learn the transition probabilities given a state space and reward function, here we use RL to learn a suitable rewad function 
which could be improve learning speed and convergence. Such a reward function is called learned intrinsic reward. We then tested this reward funcion for robotic tasks such as pick and place, slide etc.
