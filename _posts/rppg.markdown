You may be familiar with the working of an digital oximeter. Basically, it works is by measuring the intensity change in light (usually sourced by an LED), which corresponds to the changes in blood volume/flow.
Here we try to measure the same (minute) intensity changes due to blood flow but instead of a contact sensor we use a normal camera and natural light. 
in a nutshell we want to extract the heart rate of a person from its video. 

Later, we use this Remote-PPG signal for cognitive state analysis. 

This was a part of my winter 2021 internship at PLRI, TU Braunschweig under guidance of Prof. T. Deserno.
